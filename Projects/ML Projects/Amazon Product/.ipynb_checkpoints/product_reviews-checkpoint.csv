Sunbalaji,5.0 out of 5 starsAfter 6 months review. It's Good.,Reviewed in India on 19 July 2024,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After 6 months of usage i don't have much to complain about. It's the best tab at this price range for note taking(my main use case). The stylus pen(bought from xiaomi website separately) is proper for writing, now I have no notebooks lying in my tables or shelves. the 144hz screen is crisp and smooth and youtube plays at 2160p. It does all the other basic stuff just fine. Audio quality is good, the speakers are good, the OS is fine.Only problems I have faced is in Amazon prime video, sometimes the video quality is really bad and there is a procedure that I found on YouTube that you have to follow just to get the video to play at 1080p and it doesn't go beyond that. I noticed other reviews saying angel one stock trading app isn't supported, however I use zerodha and the tab supports that but I use it on my phone because that's the most convenient. But for viewing stock trading charts like trading view app that's very good to look in this tablet.battery life is mediocre, it's not bad but it isn't a strong point either. The cameras too are average, but for video calling and meetings it does the job. As for gaming, i played Minecraft and it works fine but I don't know about other more demanding games.I got it at a discounted price during a sale at that time and for that price it's a steal. For my use I'd give it a 9/10.Read more",113 people found this helpful
Shakir Chhipa,4.0 out of 5 starsXiaomi Pad 6 Review:,Reviewed in India on 29 October 2024,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A Powerhouse Tablet at an Amazing ValueThe Xiaomi Pad 6 is an absolute game-changer in the tablet space, delivering a premium experience at a fraction of the cost of many competitors. After using it extensively, I can confidently say it strikes the perfect balance between performance, display quality, and design.Display & DesignThe 11-inch 2.8K (2880x1800) display is stunning, offering vivid colors and sharp details. Whether I‚Äôm watching movies, gaming, or reading, everything looks crisp and vibrant. The 144Hz refresh rate makes scrolling buttery smooth, which enhances the overall experience‚Äîespecially for gamers or anyone who values fluid performance. The sleek metal unibody design feels solid and premium in hand, with thin bezels that maximize screen space.PerformancePowered by the Snapdragon 870 processor, the Pad 6 handles everything I throw at it effortlessly. Multitasking is a breeze, whether I‚Äôm switching between apps or working on multiple tasks side-by-side. Gaming on the tablet has been impressive as well‚Äîtitles like PUBG and Genshin Impact run smoothly, with minimal lag and great graphics quality. The 8GB of RAM ensures there are no slowdowns, even with heavy usage.Battery LifeThe 8840mAh battery is another highlight. I‚Äôve been able to use it for a full day of video streaming, social media, and light work without needing to recharge. When I do need to top it off, the 33W fast charging brings it back to life quickly.Software & FeaturesMIUI for Pad provides an intuitive, tablet-optimized experience. I love the multitasking capabilities‚Äîsplitting the screen between apps works well, and floating windows come in handy. Xiaomi has also improved on the stylus support (sold separately), making the Pad 6 a great tool for note-taking and creative work.Speakers & ConnectivityThe quad-speaker setup offers immersive audio with Dolby Atmos support, making it perfect for binge-watching or listening to music.
